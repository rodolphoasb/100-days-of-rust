// u32 in Rust represents an unsigned 32-bit integer.
// "u" stands for unsigned, meaning it can only represent non-negative numbers (0 and positive integers).
// "32" indicates the size of the integer, specifying that it occupies 32 bits in memory.
// This type can store integer values from 0 to 4,294,967,295 (2^32 - 1).


// &str vs &'static str
// Lifetime:

// &str: The lifetime is flexible and determined by the context.
// &'static str: The lifetime is always the entire duration of the program.

// Use cases:

// &str is more common and flexible. It's used for string slices with various lifetimes.
// &'static str is typically used for string literals or constants defined in the program.

// Compilation:

// &'static str values are often stored in the compiled binary.
// &str can refer to dynamically created strings or slices of other strings.
